# Content-Slider
- I created multiple instances of the component in the same page, each one with different configurations: 
(autoplay / interval / slides).

- I tested the code on different browsers, and everything worked fine.

## Some of ES6 features used in the code:
 - Class Definition
 - Template Literals
 - Arrow Functions
 - const and let Declarations
 - for...of Loop
 - Default Parameters
 - querySelector and querySelectorAll
 - forEach
